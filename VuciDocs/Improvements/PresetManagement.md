# Preset Management

## Implementation Ideas
- **Save, load, rename, and delete presets:**
  - Add UI for managing tune and scale presets.
  - Store presets locally and/or in the cloud.
  - **Ease:** Easy to moderate; mostly UI and storage logic.
  - **Issues:** Data sync, versioning, user authentication for cloud.

- **Cloud sync and sharing:**
  - Allow sharing via URL, QR code, or file export.
  - Enable cloud sync across devices.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; backend integration required.
  - **Issues:** Privacy, data security, sync conflicts.

- **Library of examples:**
  - Create searchable library of example tunes, scales, and envelopes.
  - Add tagging and categorization for easy browsing.
  - **Ease:** Easy; mostly data and UI.
  - **Issues:** Library curation, copyright for shared content.

## Summary
Preset management will help users organize and share their work, but requires robust storage and sharing logic.
