# Scale and Tuning Tools

## Implementation Ideas
- **Visual scale editor:**
  - Build a drag-and-drop interface for intervals and cent values.
  - Show real-time feedback and preview of scale changes.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; requires custom UI and data binding.
  - **Issues:** Complex UI logic, edge cases for non-standard scales.

- **Import/export scales:**
  - Support Scala (SCL), AnaMark, and other formats.
  - Add file upload and download features.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; format parsing libraries exist.
  - **Issues:** Format compatibility, error handling for malformed files.

- **Scale morphing/interpolation:**
  - Allow users to blend between two scales or temperaments.
  - Visualize morphing process and results.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; math and UI required.
  - **Issues:** Defining morphing algorithms, user expectations.

- **Scale analysis tools:**
  - Provide histogram, interval matrix, and tuning map visualizations.
  - Enable export of analysis results.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; data visualization libraries can help.
  - **Issues:** Performance for large scales, clarity of visualizations.

- **Custom scale management:**
  - Allow users to create, save, and share custom scales.
  - Add tagging and search for scale library.
  - **Ease:** Easy to moderate; mostly UI and storage logic.
  - **Issues:** Syncing across devices, scale versioning.

## Summary
Scale and tuning tools will empower users to explore and create microtonal music, but require careful UI and data design for flexibility and reliability.
