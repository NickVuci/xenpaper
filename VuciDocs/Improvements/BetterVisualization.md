## Implementation Ideas
- **Expanded pitch ruler:**
  - Show intervals, cent differences, and scale relationships visually.
  - Allow users to customize ruler appearance and data.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; visualization libraries can help.
  - **Issues:** Performance for large scores, clarity of display.

- **Piano roll/grid view:**
  - Add note editing, velocity, and duration controls in a grid.
  - Enable zoom, pan, and scroll for large scores.
  - **Ease:** Moderate to hard; custom UI required.
  - **Issues:** UI complexity, performance.

- **Color coding and visualization modes:**
  - Use colors for note types, scales, and intervals.
  - Allow toggling between pitch ruler, piano roll, and waveform views.
  - **Ease:** Easy to moderate; UI logic.
  - **Issues:** User confusion if too many modes.

- **Zoom, pan, and scroll:**
  - Enable navigation for large visualizations.
  - Add keyboard and mouse controls for navigation.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; event handling required.
  - **Issues:** Performance, accessibility.

## Summary
Better visualization will help users understand and edit microtonal music, but requires careful UI and performance optimization.
