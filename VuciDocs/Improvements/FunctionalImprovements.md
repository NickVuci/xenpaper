# Functional Improvements

This document expands on functional improvement ideas for Xenpaper, with additional details and actionable suggestions.

---

## 1. Scale and Tuning Tools
- Add a visual scale editor with drag-and-drop for intervals and cent values.
- Support importing/exporting scales in Scala (SCL), AnaMark, and other formats.
- Enable scale morphing and interpolation between different tunings.
- Provide scale analysis tools (e.g., histogram, interval matrix, tuning map).
- Allow users to create, save, and share custom scales and temperaments.

## 2. Audio Engine
- Allow selection of synthesis engines (Tone.js, Web Audio API, MIDI, SF2/SFZ soundfonts).
- Add support for MIDI export/import, including microtonal pitch bends.
- Enable advanced envelope editing (ADSR, multi-stage, morphing).
- Add built-in effects (reverb, delay, chorus, EQ) with visual controls.
- Support multi-track playback and mixing.
- Provide real-time audio visualization (waveform, spectrum, loudness).

## 3. Notation Extensions
- Support polyrhythms, tuplets, and complex time signatures in notation.
- Add dynamic markings (pp, ff, crescendos) and articulation symbols.
- Enable chord and harmony analysis with visual feedback.
- Allow custom note attributes (velocity, articulation, color).
- Provide notation export to MusicXML, LilyPond, or PDF.

## 4. Mobile and Offline Support
- Make the UI fully responsive for touch devices, with gesture controls.
- Add offline editing and playback using local storage and service workers.
- Enable installation as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
- Provide mobile-friendly visualization and editing tools.

**Summary:**
Functional improvements will expand Xenpaper's capabilities for microtonal composition, synthesis, and analysis, making it a more powerful tool for musicians and researchers.
