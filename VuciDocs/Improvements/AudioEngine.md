# Audio Engine

## Implementation Ideas
- **Synthesis engine selection:**
  - Support Tone.js, Web Audio API, MIDI, and soundfont engines.
  - Provide UI for engine selection and configuration.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; requires abstraction layer for engines.
  - **Issues:** API differences, feature parity across engines.

- **MIDI export/import:**
  - Enable export of tunes to MIDI files, including microtonal pitch bends.
  - Support MIDI file import and playback.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; MIDI libraries available.
  - **Issues:** Microtonal support, file compatibility.

- **Advanced envelope editing:**
  - Add multi-stage and morphing envelope editors.
  - Visualize envelope shapes and allow real-time preview.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; UI and audio engine integration needed.
  - **Issues:** Complexity of envelope models, user understanding.

- **Built-in effects:**
  - Add reverb, delay, chorus, EQ, and other effects with visual controls.
  - Allow effect chaining and parameter automation.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; Tone.js and Web Audio API support effects.
  - **Issues:** Performance, UI complexity.

- **Multi-track playback and mixing:**
  - Support multiple tracks with independent instruments and effects.
  - Add mixer UI for volume, pan, and mute/solo controls.
  - **Ease:** Moderate to hard; requires architectural changes.
  - **Issues:** Synchronization, resource usage.

- **Real-time audio visualization:**
  - Show waveform, spectrum, and loudness meters during playback.
  - Allow users to analyze and export visualizations.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; visualization libraries available.
  - **Issues:** Performance, accuracy of analysis.

## Summary
Audio engine improvements will make Xenpaper more versatile and professional, but require careful abstraction and UI design to support multiple engines and features.
