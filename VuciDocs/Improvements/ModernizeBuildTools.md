# Modernize Build Tools

## Implementation Ideas
- **Migrate to Vite or Next.js for faster builds, hot reload, and simpler config:**
  - Evaluate Vite and Next.js for compatibility with current codebase.
  - Incrementally migrate packages, starting with UI.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; migration guides available.
  - **Issues:** May require refactoring build scripts and configs.

- **Use Yarn Workspaces or PNPM for efficient monorepo management:**
  - Audit current workspace setup and dependencies.
  - Migrate to PNPM for faster installs and better hoisting (optional).
  - **Ease:** Easy to moderate; migration guides available.
  - **Issues:** May require updating CI/CD and developer onboarding docs.

- **Centralize and deduplicate build/config files (Babel, Jest, ESLint, Prettier):**
  - Move shared configs to root and reference in packages.
  - Use config presets and plugins for consistency.
  - **Ease:** Easy; mostly file movement and updates.
  - **Issues:** Risk of breaking builds if configs are not compatible.

- **Add automated linting, formatting, and type checking to CI/CD:**
  - Integrate ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks into pipelines.
  - Require passing checks for merges and releases.
  - **Ease:** Easy; many templates available.
  - **Issues:** May require initial setup and developer buy-in.

- **Document build and deployment processes for contributors:**
  - Write step-by-step guides for building, testing, and deploying.
  - Include troubleshooting and FAQ sections.
  - **Ease:** Easy; mostly documentation work.
  - **Issues:** Docs must be kept up to date as processes change.

## Summary
Modernizing build tools will speed up development and improve consistency, but requires careful migration and documentation to avoid disruption.
