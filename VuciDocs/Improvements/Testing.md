# Testing

## Implementation Ideas
- **Increase unit and integration test coverage for all modules:**
  - Audit existing tests and identify gaps.
  - Write new tests for untested features and edge cases.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; requires time and test writing.
  - **Issues:** May uncover bugs or require refactoring.

- **Add end-to-end tests for UI and audio engine workflows:**
  - Use tools like Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing.
  - Simulate user interactions and playback scenarios.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; setup required.
  - **Issues:** E2E tests can be brittle if UI changes frequently.

- **Use code coverage tools to identify gaps and prioritize testing:**
  - Integrate coverage tools (e.g., Istanbul, Coveralls) into CI/CD.
  - Set coverage targets and monitor over time.
  - **Ease:** Easy; most tools are plug-and-play.
  - **Issues:** Coverage does not guarantee quality; focus on meaningful tests.

- **Automate test runs with CI/CD pipelines:**
  - Set up GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or similar for automated test runs.
  - Require passing tests for merges and releases.
  - **Ease:** Easy; many templates available.
  - **Issues:** CI/CD setup may require initial configuration.

- **Write property-based and fuzz tests for parser and notation logic:**
  - Use tools like fast-check for property-based testing.
  - Generate random notation inputs to test parser robustness.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; requires learning new testing paradigms.
  - **Issues:** May uncover deep bugs or edge cases.

## Summary
Expanding and automating testing will improve reliability and confidence in Xenpaper, but requires ongoing effort and maintenance as features evolve.
