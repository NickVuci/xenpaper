# Improve Documentation

## Implementation Ideas
- **Create a comprehensive user manual and developer guide:**
  - Write step-by-step guides for users and contributors.
  - Include screenshots, code samples, and example workflows.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; requires time and writing effort.
  - **Issues:** Keeping docs up to date with code changes.

- **Document all experimental features, design decisions, and rationale:**
  - Add dedicated sections for experimental patterns and why they were chosen.
  - Use changelogs to track major decisions and migrations.
  - **Ease:** Easy to moderate; can be done incrementally.
  - **Issues:** May require interviews or retrospectives with original authors.

- **Add API documentation for core modules and components:**
  - Use tools like TypeDoc or JSDoc to generate API docs from code comments.
  - Document input/output types, side effects, and usage examples.
  - **Ease:** Easy; can be automated.
  - **Issues:** Requires consistent code commenting.

- **Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate architecture and data flow:**
  - Create diagrams with tools like Mermaid, PlantUML, or draw.io.
  - Include diagrams in docs and README files.
  - **Ease:** Easy; visual tools are widely available.
  - **Issues:** Diagrams must be updated as architecture changes.

- **Maintain changelogs and migration guides for major updates:**
  - Use CHANGELOG.md and migration docs for breaking changes.
  - **Ease:** Easy; standard practice.
  - **Issues:** Requires discipline to update with every release.

## Summary
Improved documentation will help users and contributors understand and extend Xenpaper, but requires ongoing effort to keep docs current and relevant.
