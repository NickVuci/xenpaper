# Refactor for Modularity

## Implementation Ideas
- **Split parsing, playback, and UI logic into separate packages/modules:**
  - Create distinct directories or npm packages for each concern (e.g., `@xenpaper/parser`, `@xenpaper/playback`, `@xenpaper/ui`).
  - Use clear entry points and exports for each module.
  - Refactor shared logic into utility modules.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; requires code movement and interface definition.
  - **Issues:** Risk of breaking dependencies; need for clear API contracts.

- **Use clear interfaces and types for communication between modules:**
  - Define TypeScript interfaces for data passed between parser, playback, and UI.
  - Use type guards and validation to ensure data integrity.
  - **Ease:** Easy to moderate; can be incremental.
  - **Issues:** May require refactoring existing code to match new interfaces.

- **Standardize state management:**
  - Use dendriform only for deeply nested/collaborative state.
  - Use React Context/useState for simple state.
  - Document rationale for each state management choice.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; may require refactoring components.
  - **Issues:** Risk of inconsistent state updates if not coordinated.

- **Document module boundaries and responsibilities:**
  - Add README files and code comments to each module/package.
  - Use diagrams to show data flow and dependencies.
  - **Ease:** Easy; mostly documentation work.
  - **Issues:** Documentation must be kept up to date as code evolves.

## Summary
Refactoring for modularity will improve maintainability and scalability, but requires careful planning and incremental implementation to avoid breaking changes.
