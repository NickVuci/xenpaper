## Implementation Ideas
- **Real-time multi-user editing:**
  - Use WebSockets or WebRTC for live collaboration.
  - Show presence indicators and edit history.
  - **Ease:** Hard; requires backend and conflict resolution logic.
  - **Issues:** Sync conflicts, latency, user authentication.

- **Chat and comments:**
  - Add chat or comment threads for collaborative sessions.
  - Allow inline comments on notation and scales.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; UI and backend integration.
  - **Issues:** Moderation, notification logic.

- **Version history, branching, and merge tools:**
  - Track changes and allow branching/merging of tunes.
  - Visualize version history and diffs.
  - **Ease:** Hard; requires data model and UI changes.
  - **Issues:** Complexity, user education.

- **Granular permissions:**
  - Set read-only, edit, and admin permissions for collaborators.
  - Manage permissions via UI and backend.
  - **Ease:** Moderate; backend and UI logic.
  - **Issues:** Security, permission escalation.

## Summary
Collaboration features will enable new workflows, but require significant backend and UI development for reliability and security.
