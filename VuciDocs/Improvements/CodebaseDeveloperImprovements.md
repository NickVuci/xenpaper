# Codebase & Developer Experience Improvements

This document expands on codebase and developer experience improvement ideas for Xenpaper, with additional details and actionable suggestions.

---

## 1. Refactor for Modularity
- Split parsing, playback, and UI logic into separate packages/modules.
- Use clear interfaces and types for communication between modules.
- Standardize state management: use dendriform only for deeply nested/collaborative state, useContext/useState elsewhere.
- Document module boundaries and responsibilities.

## 2. Improve Documentation
- Create a comprehensive user manual and developer guide.
- Document all experimental features, design decisions, and rationale.
- Add API documentation for core modules and components.
- Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate architecture and data flow.
- Maintain changelogs and migration guides for major updates.

## 3. Testing
- Increase unit and integration test coverage for all modules.
- Add end-to-end tests for UI and audio engine workflows.
- Use code coverage tools to identify gaps and prioritize testing.
- Automate test runs with CI/CD pipelines.
- Write property-based and fuzz tests for parser and notation logic.

## 4. Modernize Build Tools
- Migrate to Vite or Next.js for faster builds, hot reload, and simpler config.
- Use Yarn Workspaces or PNPM for efficient monorepo management.
- Centralize and deduplicate build/config files (Babel, Jest, ESLint, Prettier).
- Add automated linting, formatting, and type checking to CI/CD.
- Document build and deployment processes for contributors.

**Summary:**
Codebase and developer experience improvements will make Xenpaper easier to maintain, extend, and contribute to, supporting future growth and collaboration.
