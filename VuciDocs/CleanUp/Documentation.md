# Documentation

## Overview

This document analyzes documentation in the Xenpaper codebase, focusing on fragmentation and coverage of experimental features, and provides recommendations for refactoring.

## What to Examine
- Centralization of docs
- Code comments and usage examples
- Documentation of experimental patterns

## Template for Analysis
- **Instance:** Doc file/module
- **Analysis:** Description of the documentation issue
- **Recommendation:** Actionable steps for improvement

## Detailed Analysis

# Documentation: Instance-by-Instance Analysis

## Overview
Documentation in Xenpaper is fragmented, with some experimental features and patterns lacking coverage.

## Instances & Analysis

### 1. Main Docs
- **Files:** `README.md`, `VuciDocs/BasicOverview.md`, etc.
- **Analysis:** Provides high-level overview and basic usage.
- **Problems:** Lacks detailed documentation for experimental features and code structure.
- **Options:** Expand main docs with architecture and rationale for patterns.
- **Recommendation:** Add architecture and pattern documentation to main docs.

### 2. Experimental Docs
- **Files:** `VuciDocs/ExperimentalStuff/*.md`
- **Analysis:** Documents experimental patterns and libraries (dendriform, craco, etc.).
- **Problems:** Some patterns are documented, but not all instances or rationale are covered.
- **Options:** Expand docs to cover all experimental features and their usage.
- **Recommendation:** Audit and expand experimental docs.

### 3. Code Comments
- **Files:** Source files across packages
- **Analysis:** Some code comments exist, but coverage is inconsistent.
- **Problems:** Lack of comments for complex logic and experimental patterns.
- **Options:** Add comments to complex and experimental code.
- **Recommendation:** Audit and expand code comments.

### 4. Usage Examples
- **Files:** Docs and source files
- **Analysis:** Some usage examples in docs, but not for all features.
- **Problems:** Missing examples for advanced and experimental features.
- **Options:** Add usage examples to docs and code.
- **Recommendation:** Expand usage examples throughout docs and code.

## Summary & Refactoring Recommendations
- Centralize and expand documentation for architecture, patterns, and experimental features.
- Audit and add code comments and usage examples.
