# xenpaper

Repo for [https://dxinteractive.github.io/xenpaper/](https://dxinteractive.github.io/xenpaper/), formerly xenpaper.com, a little side project form a few years ago to make microtonal notation audible. This project is officially archived, I will not be (or have been) developing features, fixing bugs or accepting PRs for a couple of years now. Feel free to fork if you want to take up ownership! That is the beauty of open source.

If you do fork, I apologise in advance. The source code is not good. I used this project to trial a few different new technologies and experiemtnal patterns, and I dont think any were successful enough to repeat. I do like how the UI turned out from a users perspective though.
